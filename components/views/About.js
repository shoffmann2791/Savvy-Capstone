    <h1>HI, I AM SALLY.</h1>

    <p>
      I am not an topnotch photographer. I am just a mom who loves taking photos
      of her child and realized that I was pretty good at it. As a mom, I am
      passionate about capturing my child at milestone. These are moments I will
      never get back so I take every advantage that I can. My photography
      approach focuses on capturing the momments you share with people you
      cherish.
