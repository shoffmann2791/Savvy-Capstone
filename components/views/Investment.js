      <h3>THE EXPERIENCE</h3>

    <p> I. Before your session

        Inquiry. Simply hit the book now button and it'll take you to my *contact page*. Fill out the form provided and hit submit! From there I get your email, we discuss what you are looking for in a session to ensure I can meet your needs. We discuss the packages available. And then an invoice for the session fee is sent over with a contract, and you are officially booked.
        
        II. During your session
        
        I am involved with the planning of your session from initial contact because I want to create a stress-free experience. I make the experience personable and take the time to get to know you and your family. I help with styling wardrobe and picking a location, and all I need from you is to bring you (and your family) and enjoy the experience.
        
        I am a mother, so I know how difficult it can be to work with children. Rest assured, I take every precaution and step to help your children relax and simply be themselves. I also provide bubbles for the end of the session. I find this is a great bribe to help the kiddos enjoy the photos more so we can get those great shots!
        
        III. After your session
        
        After the session, your sneak peeks will be ready within 2-3 days. You are free to tag yourself and share with family on Social Media. Your full gallery for viewing is ready within two-three weeks following that. This is where you can choose which package you want AFTER you see your gallery. After you've fallen in love with your images. I am with you every step of the way to ensure a smooth, easy process.
