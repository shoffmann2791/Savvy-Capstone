    I am involved with the planning of your session from initial contact to
    create a stress free experience. I help with styling wardrobe and picking a
    location, and all I need from you is to bring you (and your family) and
    enjoy the experience. After the session, your sneak peeks will be ready
    within 2-3 days. You are free to tag yourself and share with family on
    Social Media. Think you're ready to book with me? Check out the pricing
    below and let's connect!
