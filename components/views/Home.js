      <h1>A FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHER IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.</h1>

      <h2>I AM A STORYTELLER.</h2>

      <h3>YOUR STORY STARTS HERE.</h3>
   
 
    <p> I am *Sally*, a St. Louis Photographer. I emphasize in *Family Photography* as well as *Children's Photography* and Maternity Photography. I take lifestyle photography approach to the way I shoot versus what most consider portrait photography. I focus on the connection you share with your favorite people and how you feel when you are around them. I tell YOUR story.
      I love to think of photographs as our very own personal time machine. And as such, it makes them timeless. I started my photography journey because of my passion to capture the growth of my own children. So as a mom, I understand that time flies in the blink of an eye and all I want to do is hold time still so I can enjoy every chapter in my child's life.
