    <h2>I AM A STORYTELLER.</h2>

    <h3>YOUR STORY STARTS HERE.</h3>

    <p>
      I am Sally, a St. Louis Photographer. I emphasize in Family Photography as
      well as Children's Photography. I focus on the connection you share with
      your favorite people and how you feel when you are around them. I tell
      YOUR story. I love to think of photographs as our very own personal time
      machine. And as such, it makes them timeless. I started my photography
      journey because of my passion to capture the growth of my own child. So as
      a mom, I understand that time flies in the blink of an eye and all I want
      to do is hold time still so I can enjoy every chapter in my child's life.
